<h2>About our Collection Guides</h2>
<hr />
<p>
    The collection guides on this website identify, describe, and list archival material that is housed at Joyner Library and Laupus Health Sciences Library at East Carolina University. Most collection guides also contain information about the person or organization who created the material. Some of the items described in the collection guides are available online, and links to these digital objects are included within the collection guide.

    Our collection guides vary in their depth and detail. We sometimes have additional information about a collection that is not listed online. If you have further questions about a collection, please contact the appropriate library listed below.
